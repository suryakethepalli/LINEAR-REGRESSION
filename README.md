# LINEAR-REGRESSION ON SALES ESTIMATION

The goal of this project is to Predict the Future Sales that will be increased by investing on ADVERTISING  on different platforms  such as (TV, RADIO, NEWSPAPER)

Problem Statement :- a company wants to increase its sells to a certain amount. Now the challenge is to find the amount of investment on advertisement that will result the gain in sells.

To solve this problem we have to get the history of the investment and the sales value , all these information is prepared as a dataset

Training method:

Linear Regression : is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.

It performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output).


FLIE'S DESCRIPTION :

Advertising_data.csv - the information on number of sales taken place through different Advertising modes(TV, RADIO , NEWSPAPERS)

LINEAR REGRESSION - SALES ESTIMATION PREDICTION.ipynb - contains python ML Code that gives us a graph between No.sales taken place previously Through TV ads and total sales

ML Tools OR Libraries used :

1. Numpy 
2. Pandas
3. matplotlib
4. Sk Learn (linear model)


STEPS PERFORMED :
1. Import the Libraries
2. Import the dataset
3. Understand the dataset
4. Slicing the dataset
5. Segregate and reshape the variables
6. Scatter plot
7. Divide the dataset into training and test set
8. Perform the Linear Regression
9. Check Prediction
10. Visualize the regressor line
